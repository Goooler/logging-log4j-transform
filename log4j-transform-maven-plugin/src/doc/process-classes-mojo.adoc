Full name::

`org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-transform-maven-plugin:0.1.0:process-classes`

Generates static location information of Log4j 2.x API calls in the project classes.
The resulting bytecode will not rely on runtime resolution of the location information.

 * Requires dependency resolution of artifacts in scope: `<code>compile</code>`
 * The goal is thread-safe and supports parallel builds
 * Binds by default to the http://maven.apache.org/ref/current/maven-core/lifecycles.html[lifecycle phase]: `process-classes`.
